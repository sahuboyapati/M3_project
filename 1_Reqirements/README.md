Car Wiper Components
Car wipers do consist of various components such as the wiper blade, link, switch, motor, and arm.

Wiper Motor
Motor Wiper

The wiper motor is one part of the wiper system that is useful for moving the wiper automatically. The commonly used wiper motor utilizes a magnet with a reduction gear. There are at least 2 types of wiper motors that can cause magnetic fields, namely the ferrite magnet type which uses permanent magnet ferrite, and the wound rotor type which uses a coil to produce an electromagnet.


Wiper Link

The wiper link is often referred to as the wiper lever which is useful for changing the rotation motion of the wiper motor into a movement that goes back and forth from the left and right. The front of the car usually uses a wiper system that uses two blades at once and the mechanism used to move the two blades using a parallel tandem system.

When the wiper starts to turn on, the wiper motor will rotate the crank arm and this will make the connecting rods pull and push each other. The wiper link will make the wiper arm work in a semicircle around the pivot shaft. The linking rod or connecting rod which is usually attached to the two wiper arms will make the two blades work simultaneously and work in parallel.

Wiper Arm
The wiper arm usually consists of a head that is used to tie the wiper arm to the wiper shaft. The springs will be useful for holding the blade. While the arm piece will be useful for the process of installing the blade and retainer to hold it completely.

Wiper Blade
The wiper blade usually consists of a rubber which is useful for cleaning the surface of the car glass. There is a combination of leaf spring packing with levers and clips to attach the blade to the wiper arm.
